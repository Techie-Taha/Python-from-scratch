The most important method is len, len helps to find the numbers of character in a string
name = "Taha"
print (len(name)) #This len operator helps to determine the number of character, this case it's 4

number = [1,2,3] # or we can do (1, 2, 3) same ouput like 3
print (len(number)) #also for numbers 

___2___
startswith method
name = "Taha"
print(name.startswith("Ta")) # in the terminal we will see true, However it is case sensitive so if we do ta, it will be false

___3___
endswith method 
name ="Taha"
print(name.endswith(ha)) # in the terminal we will see true.

___4___
find method, check for the index
name = "Invader"
print(name.find("d")) #this find operator helps to determine the index, which is 4

___5___
in operator works like a boolean expression, true or false
name = "Taha"
print('Taha' in name) #in operator works like a boolean expression and in the terminal we will see true
print('taha' in name) #here we will see false in the terminal since I put lowercase t

Another example: 
num = ["Taha", 65, "Apple", 76.5, "Nishat", False]
if "taha" in num:
    print("True")
else:
    print("false") # in the terminal we will false because I put a lower case taha, if I would have write Taha, it will return true


___6___
replace method helps to replace old with new characers or alphabets 

statement = "Nothing is better than nothing"
print (statement.replace('Nothing' , 'Something')) # in the terminal we will see something is better than nothing
                         #old         #new
print (statement.replace('Not' , 'Somet')) #we can also replace alphabets
a = "Taha"
b = a[0]
print(a)
print(a.replace("T" , "P")) # in the terminal we will see Paha

___7___
capitalize method only capitalize the first alphabet of the string
name_2 = "nishat"
print(name_2.capitalize()) # in the terminal we should see nishat

___8___
upper method convert the whole string into upper case, same with lower method
name = "Taha"
print(name.upper())
name_2 = "NISHAT"
print(name_2.lower())
___9___
logical operator
Logical operators: and, or, not
has_high_income = True
has_good_habit = True

eligibility = "eligible for loan"

if has_high_income and has_good_habit:
    print(eligibility)
else:
    print("not eligible")

has_criminal_record = True
has_murder_record = False

eligibility = "eligible for citizenship"

if has_high_income or has_good_habit:
    print(eligibility)
else:
    print("not eligible")
# since both true, also because of and operator it will return eligible 
# if one of the statement is false, also has and operator it will return false not eligible
# if one of the statement is false, also has or operator it will return True because in that case only one of the condition needs to be true eligible
# and not operator makes true statement false, and false statement true

___10___
Escape sequence character, one of the most important is \n, which helps to create line 2, and we can add it multiple times, and actually there's more of them
statement = "Taha is a motherfucker\nbut helpful sometimes"
print(statement) 
In the terminal we will see 
Taha is a motherfucker 
but helpful sometimes
